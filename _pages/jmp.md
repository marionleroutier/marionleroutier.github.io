__The Cost of Air Pollution for Workers and Firms__, with Hélène Ollivier
 <p align="justify"> Poor air quality has been found to negatively affect workers’ physical health and cognitive functions, but we know little about the economy-wide consequences for firms. This paper assembles a unique dataset combining daily observations of sickness leave incidence for 400,000 French workers between 2009 and 2015, the monthly sales of firms employing them, and fine-grained pollution data. Exploiting local variations in wind direction as an instrument for exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution, we find that a 10% increase in monthly PM2.5 increases workers’ risk of sickness leave that month by 1%. While we fail to detect an impact of pollution on firms’ monthly sales on average, sectoral analyses reveal a negative effect in manufacturing, construction and professional services. The associated cost is economically significant: respecting the WHO’s air quality recommendations would have avoided, on an average year, 2 million days of sick leave and at least €6 billion of sales losses (0.3% of French GDP). Our analysis has three main implications: first, air pollution negatively affects firms via other channels than sickness-related absenteeism; second, only focusing on health costs underestimates the total cost of air pollution to society. Third, even in a high-income, low-pollution context, the benefits of additional pollution reductions seem to largely compensate the costs.
