__Welcome to my website!__


* I'm an applied environmental economist focusing on two major environmental issues, ambient air pollution and climate change.

* I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (<a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/institutes/misum-startpage/">Misum</a>), at the Stockholm School of Economics (<a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/de/">SSE</a>). I'm also affiliated with SSE's Department of Economics.

* I completed my PhD in economics at the Paris School of Economics (PSE) and CIRED in July 2021, co-advised by Prof. Katheline Schubert (PSE, Paris 1) and Prof. Philippe Quirion (CIRED). 
  
* My PhD was awarded the <a href="https://www.eaere.org/best-european-doctoral-dissertation-award/">Best Doctoral Dissertation Award </a> by the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.
