__Welcome to my website!__


* I'm an __applied environmental economist__ focusing on two major environmental issues, __ambient air pollution__ and __climate change__.

* I'm currently a __postdoctoral fellow__ at the <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/">__Institute for Fiscal Studies__</a>.

* My __research agenda__ has two angles. In a first angle, I investigate the __societal cost of air pollution__ and the __causal impact of climate and environmental policies__, with an emphasis on health, productivity and distributional effects. In a second and more early-stage angle, I study the __determinants of support for green policies__, in particular the role of social norms and identity.
   
* In September 2024, I will join <a href="https://www.ensae.fr/en">__ENSAE__</a> and <a href="https://crest.science/about-2/">__CREST__</a> in Paris as an __Assistant Professor__.

* I completed my __PhD__ at the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/">__Paris School of Economics__</a> and <a href="https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/">__CIRED__</a>. I received the 2022 Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE).
 
* You can find my __cv__ <a href="http://marionleroutier.github.io/files/Leroutier_cv_EN.pdf">here</a>.
