__Welcome to my website!__


* I'm an __applied environmental economist__ focusing on two major environmental issues, __ambient air pollution__ and __climate change__.

* I'm an __Assistant Professor__ at <a href="https://crest.science/about-2/">__CREST__</a> and <a href="https://www.ensae.fr/en">__ENSAE__</a> in Paris.  I'm also a research affiliate at the <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/">__the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS)__</a>, the  <a href="https://www.ipp.eu/en/">__Institut des Politiques Publiques (IPP)__</a> and <a href="https://www.hhs.se/misum">__the House of Sustainable Society (HOSS)__</a>.

* My __current research__ seeks to answer three broad questions, mostly in the European context:  
  1. What are the __societal costs of air pollution__? including health and non-health effects.  
  2. To what extent do climate policies deliver __health co-benefits__? with an emphasis on the transport and electricity sectors.
  3. What are the __determinants of support for green policies__? with an emphasis on social norms and identity.
