__Welcome to my website!__


* I'm an __applied environmental economist__ focusing on two major environmental issues, ambient air pollution and climate change.
 
* I'm currently a __post-doctoral researcher__ at the __Stockholm School of Economics__ (<a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/de/">SSE</a>), based at <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/institutes/misum-startpage/">Misum</a>. I'm also affiliated with SSE's Department of Economics. I completed my PhD at the __Paris School of Economics__ in 2021. My Dissertation earned the 2022 

* I will join <a href="https://www.ensae.fr/en">ENSAE</a> and <a href="https://crest.science/">CREST</a> as a __tenure-track Assistant professor__ in Economics in September 2024. Before that, I will be a __postdoctoral fellow__ at the __Institute for Fiscal Studies__ (<a href="https://ifs.org.uk/">IFS</a>) in the academic year 2023/2024.
 
* __My current research agenda has two angles__. In a first angle, I investigate the cost of air pollution and the causal impact of climate and environmental policies, with an emphasis on health, productivity and distributional effects. My <a href="https://marionleroutier.github.io/files/LeroutierOllivier_2022_cost_pollution_jmp.pdf">Job Market Paper</a> examines the causal effect of acute exposure to air pollution on worker absenteeism and firms' sales. In a second and more early-stage angle, I study the effects of social norms and identity on environmental outcomes and support for environmental policies.

* You can find my __cv__ <a href="http://marionleroutier.github.io/files/Leroutier_cv_EN.pdf">here</a>.
