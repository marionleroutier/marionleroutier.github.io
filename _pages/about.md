__Welcome to my website!__


* I'm an __applied environmental economist__ focusing on two major environmental issues, __ambient air pollution__ and __climate change__.

* My __current research agenda__ has two angles. In a first angle, I investigate the __societal cost of air pollution__ and the __causal impact of climate and environmental policies__, with an emphasis on health, productivity and distributional effects. In a second and more early-stage angle, I study the __determinants of support for green policies__, in particular the role of social norms and identity.
 
* I'm currently a __post-doctoral researcher__ at the __Stockholm School of Economics__ (<a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/de/">SSE</a>), based at <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/institutes/misum-startpage/">Misum</a>, a multidisciplinary research center on sustainability. I'm also affiliated with SSE's Department of Economics. 

* I will join <a href="https://www.ensae.fr/en">ENSAE</a> and <a href="https://crest.science/">CREST</a> as a __tenure-track Assistant professor__ in September 2024. In the academic year 2023/2024, I will be a __postdoctoral fellow__ at the __Institute for Fiscal Studies__ (<a href="https://ifs.org.uk/">IFS</a>). 

* I completed my __PhD__ at the __Paris School of Economics__ (<a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/">PSE</a>) in July 2021. My PhD received the 2022 Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE).
 
* You can find my __cv__ <a href="http://marionleroutier.github.io/files/Leroutier_cv_EN.pdf">here</a>.
