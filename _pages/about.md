__Welcome to my website!__


* I'm an __applied environmental economist__ focusing on two major environmental issues, ambient air pollution and climate change.
 
* I'm currently a __post-doctoral researcher__ at the __Stockholm School of Economics__ (<a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/de/">SSE</a>), based at <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/institutes/misum-startpage/">Misum</a>. I'm also affiliated with SSE's Department of Economics. 

* __I am on the 2022-2023 job market, and I will be available for interviews at the EEA 2022 and the ASSA 2023 meetings.__
 
* My current research agenda has two angles. In a first angle, I investigate the cost of air pollution and the causal impact of climate and environmental policies, with an emphasis on health, productivity and distributional effects. My <a href="https://marionleroutier.github.io/files/LeroutierOllivier_2022_cost_pollution_jmp.pdf">Job Market Paper</a> examines the causal effect of acute exposure to air pollution on worker absenteeism and firms' sales. In a second and more early-stage angle, I study the effects of social norms and identity on environmental outcomes and support for environmental policies.


* I completed my PhD in economics at the __Paris School of Economics__ (<a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/">PSE</a>) and <a href="https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/">CIRED</a> in July 2021, co-advised by Prof. Katheline Schubert (PSE, Paris 1) and Prof. Philippe Quirion (CIRED, CNRS). 
  
* My PhD dissertation was awarded the <a href="https://www.eaere.org/best-european-doctoral-dissertation-award/">Best Doctoral Dissertation Award </a> by the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists and the <a href="https://www.sorbonne.fr/wp-content/uploads/Liste-Laur%C3%A9ats-PDC-2022.pdf">1st Prize of the PhD Award in Economics</a> by the Chancellerie des Universit√©s de Paris.
