__Welcome to my website!__


* I'm an __applied environmental economist__ focusing on two major environmental issues, __ambient air pollution__ and __climate change__.

* I'm currently a __postdoctoral fellow__ at the <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/">__Institute for Fiscal Studies__</a> in London.  In September 2024, I will join <a href="https://crest.science/about-2/">__CREST__</a> and <a href="https://www.ensae.fr/en">__ENSAE__</a> in Paris as an __Assistant Professor__. I'm also a research affiliate at <a href="https://www.hhs.se/misum">__Misum__</a> and the <a href="https://www.ipp.eu/en/">__IPP__</a>.

* My __current research__ seeks to answer three broad questions, mostly in the European context:  
  1. What are the __societal costs of air pollution__? including health and non-health effects.  
  2. To what extent do climate policies deliver __health co-benefits__? with an emphasis on the transport and electricity sectors.
  3. What are the __determinants of support for green policies__? with an emphasis on social norms and identity.

* I completed my __PhD__ at the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/">__Paris School of Economics__</a> and <a href="https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/">__CIRED__</a>. I received the 2022 Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE).
