    <p align="justify"> Decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation is crucial to tackle climate change. Empirically, however, little is known about the effectiveness of existing economic instruments in the power sector. This paper examines the impact of the UK Carbon Price Support (CPS), a carbon tax implemented in the UK power sector in 2013. Relative to a synthetic control unit built from other European countries, I find that emissions from the UK power sector declined by 20 to 26 percent per year on average between 2013 and 2017. The tax operated via three mechanisms: a decrease in emissions at the intensive margin; the closure of some high-emission plants at the extensive margin; and a higher probability of closure for plants already at risk due to European air quality regulations.

    <br>
    <p align="justify"> Urban road transport is an important source of local pollution and carbon emissions. Designing effective and fair policies tackling these externalities requires understanding who contributes to emissions today. We estimate individual transport-induced pollution footprints combining a travel demand survey from the Paris area with NOx, PM2.5 and CO2 emission factors. We find that the top 20% emitters contribute 75-85% of emissions on a representative weekday. They combine longer distances travelled, a high car modal share and, especially for local pollutants, a higher emission intensity of car trips. Living in the suburbs, being a man and being employed are the most important characteristics associated with top emissions. Among the employed, those commuting from suburbs to suburbs, working at a factory, with atypical working hours or with a manual, shopkeeping or top executive occupation are more likely to be top emitters. Finally, policies targeting local pollution may be more regressive than those targeting CO2 emissions, due to the different correlation between income and the local pollutant vs. CO2 emission intensity of car trips.

* __The Cost of Air Pollution for Workers and Firms__, with Hélène Ollivier
  * <details>
    <summary> Abstract: </summary>
    <br>
    <p align="justify">  Poor air quality has been found to negatively affect workers’ physical health and cognitive functions, but we know little about the economy-wide consequences for firms. This paper assembles a unique dataset combining daily observations of sickness leave incidence for 400,000 French workers between 2009 and 2015, the monthly sales of firms employing them, and fine-grained pollution data. Exploiting local variations in wind direction as an instrument for exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution, we find that a 10% increase in monthly PM2.5 increases workers’ risk of sickness leave that month by 1%. While we fail to detect an impact of pollution on firms’ monthly sales on average, sectoral analyses reveal a negative effect in manufacturing, construction and professional services. The associated cost is economically significant: respecting the WHO’s air quality recommendations would have avoided, on an average year, 2 million days of sick leave and at least €6 billion of sales losses (0.3% of French GDP). Our analysis has three main implications: first, air pollution negatively affects firms via other channels than sickness-related absenteeism; second, only focusing on health costs underestimates the total cost of air pollution to society. Third, even in a high-income, low-pollution context, the benefits of additional pollution reductions seem to largely compensate the costs.

* __Estimating the Local Air Pollution Impacts of Maritime Traffic: A Principled Approach for Observational Data__, with Leo Zabrocki and Marie-Abele Bind

     <summary> Abstract: </summary>
     <br>
     <p align="justify"> We propose a new approach to estimate the causal effects of maritime traffic when natural or policy experiments are not available. We apply this method to the case of Marseille, a large Mediterranean port city, where air pollution emitted by cruise vessels is a growing concern. Using a recent matching algorithm designed for time series data, we create hypothetical randomized experiments to estimate the change in local air pollution caused by a short-term increase in cruise traffic. We then rely on randomization inference to compute nonparametric 95% uncertainty intervals. We find that cruise vessels’ arrivals have large impacts on city-level hourly concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. At the daily level, road traffic seems however to have a much larger impact than cruise traffic. Our procedure also helps assess in a transparent manner the identification challenges specific to this type of high-frequency time series data.

* __Tackling car emissions in urban areas: Shift, Avoid, Improve__, with Philippe Quirion 

  * <details>
    <summary> Abstract: </summary>
    <br>
    <p align="justify">  The environmental externalities associated with car use represent a signi cant cost to society. Using a representative transport survey from the Paris area, we investigate to what extent car use could be i)shifted to low-emission modes, ii)avoided via teleworking, or iii)improved via a transition to electric vehicles. According to our scenario analysis based on counterfactual travel time data for 45,000 observed car trips, 40% of car users could realistically shift to e-bike - mostly - or public transit - in a few cases - with an increase in travel time of one minute per day on average. Such modal shift would reduce CO2 and local pollutant emissions from daily mobility by around 15%, generating climate and health benefits worth around €140 million per year. Inability to undertake a modal shift is associated with living in the outer suburbs, being retired, being a man and having a high income. Another 5% of total emissions could be avoided if all the "car-dependent" individuals able to work from home did so for two days a week. Holding demand for mobility and public transport infrastructure fixed, achieving greater emission reductions would require improving car use via a transition to electric vehicles.
